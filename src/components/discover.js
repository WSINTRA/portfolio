        <p className="monospace">
          It has been a long and exciting journey, I left school thinking I knew 
          what the world was and my place in it.<br/><br/> In my youth I was a nerdy
          teenager spending late nights on<a style={{ cursor: "pointer", textDecoration: "underline"}} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hack3r.com/ClassicMoments"> IRC </a>
         hanging out with hackers and
          learning the lingo and the history. <br/>Whilst studying C/C++, with a home
          learning course. <br/><br/>I applied for an apprenticeship and joined BT in 2004 I felt very fortunate to be
          in such a great program. <br/>Eventually transitioning from
          telecommunications engineering to youth work and education. <br/>A musician
          with a love for the community. 
          <i className="icofont-nerd-smile"></i>
          <br/><br/>Taking on new qualifications and
          shifting my focus. <br/>I jumped the Atlantic ocean and landed in New York City! <br/>
          Here I reconnected with my nerdy teenage self and became interested in the world of code
          and software development. <br/><br/>A lot of self study and some community
          volunteering kept me busy before beginning the in-campus
          Full-Stack Engineering bootcamp at the Flatiron School in Brooklyn DUMBO. 
          I love software development, discovering and thinking about how all the
          complex pieces of the system fit together. <br/><br/>I still keep to my community engagement work
          in the education sphere and enjoy being part of some really amazing
          projects in NYC. <br/><br/>With my new
          found love for Processing and p5js, I am building the bridge between
          creative artist and software development with live visual audio
          performances. Producing music on the fly with visuals created
          in processing! <br/><br/>Passions aside, professionally I am still learning in
          my work environment and finding ways I can bring my many experiences
          to the projects I am engaged in. Some of the newer technologies I am
          getting to grips with include GraphQL, Prisma, React Native and Apollo. <br/>Check out my github for the code.<br/><br/>

/**From a mixed background in telecommunications engineering industry and music education, 
          I have learnt many things in
          my career that can contribute as transferrable skills in modern
          software development.<br/><br/>Starting my professional working career as an
          apprentice telecommunications network engineer at British Telecom in
          2004.<br/> <br/>
          After graduating from the apprenticeship I moved into the 21CN fibre
          optic network delivery team. I was responsible for installing large
          fibre trunk communication networks that carried information across the UK. I
          learnt how to configure, test and install these fibre optical data
          networks and gained a good working knowledge of large
          telecommunications networks and gained valuable experience working in
          a specialist team. After leaving BT in 2010 I continued working as a
          contractor in similar engineering roles as well as some time as a Linux System security specialist all whilst studying C/C++ at home.
          <br/> <br/> 
          In 2014 I studied Electrical
          Engineering for a 1 year foundational degree at Teesside University.
          After completing my first year and doing some world travelling I began
          volunteering as a Youth Worker at a local music studio and youth
          centre. Here I gained valuable experience leading groups of young
          people and delivering music education, eventually founding my own
          company and gaining Youth Work qualifications from Hartlepool College.
          <br/> <br/>
          With these new skills I began working in schools with at-risk youth
          and vulnerable youth with learning disabilities, delivering specialist
          community music workshops. 
          <br/> <br/>
          In 2017 I moved to New York City and after attending the Flatiron School of coding, I had gained hands on
          experience in Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React and
          Redux. I finished code school and my Software Development Career
          began. Since I have gained valuable experience in software engineer and found a balance between
          creative artist and pragmatic engineer.
          <br/> <br/>
          The early days of experimenting with
          Linux and learning networking skills has given me a deep understanding
          of computer systems and the possibilities available. */
